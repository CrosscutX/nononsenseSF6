# No Nonsense SF6

#### Video Demo:

#### Descripton: No Nonsense SF6 is a static site that uses my knowledge of fighting games to create a guide. It's designed so that other players could easily view and digest said information, a way that that's designed to build them up from a very low level of experience, into a much more well rounded player. The information was created all from me, but leverages my almost 10 years of experience playing the genre, on top of dozens of coaching sessions with other players, to create a guide that targets the root casue of most issues people encounter when trying to learn the games.

#### The primary technology used here is react.
