        Fighting games are one of the most compelling genres of games out there.
        There are few games that can match the thrill and excitement that comes
        from a tense back and forth tournament set where any small mistake could
        mean disaster. Fighting games have allowed me to connect with friends
        and legitimately allowed me to learn about myself and improve
        personally, in ways that help me in my day to day life. Sadly, because
        of the intimidating nature of the genre, many people abandon the journey
        before they get a chance to realize just how captivating it can be.

        My goal is to help bridge that gap for less experienced fighting game
        players, and help them gain a deeper understanding of the theory behind
        Street Fighter and hopefully allow them to gain a deeper appreciation
        and understanding of why fighting game players are so passionate for the
        genre.
