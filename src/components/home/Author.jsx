        My name is Alex, more commonly known as Crosscut, and yes I have a
        really nasty dragon punch. I'm a player out of Ohio who's been playing
        competitively for about 9 years now. After finally getting sick of
        League of Legends in 2015, I decided to make the jump to fighting games
        and since then I've never looked back. I started competing in 2016, and
        since then I've competed in countless online tournaments, and even some
        offline tournaments here and there including EVO.

        I've been an 0-2'er and I've won my own fair share of tournaments too.
        Winning tons of local tournaments around Ohio, and getting top 8's in
        difficult online tournaments like TNS.

        Fighting games never came easy to me, I lost my first match online in
        sf4 to a Ryu who jump heavy kick and swept me over and over again.
        Because I've never had any talent for the genre, I've had to build
        ironclad fundamentals from the ground up, and I believe this is what
        makes me uniquely qualified to teach fighting games.

        In my free time I've performed free coaching for dozens of people. And
        during that process I've gotten insight on the struggles of players from
        many different skill levels. This site uses the lessons I've learned
        from that to craft effective lessons that tackle common issues.
