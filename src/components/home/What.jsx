        This site is a collection lessons and resources designed to turn you
        into a strong fighting game player as quickly as possible. With so many
        fighting game concepts, it can be difficult to know what you should be
        focusing on. I aim to distill the most necessary information in short
        lessons that aim to not waste your time. Lessons are organized by
        experience level, so there should be something here for just about
        everyone. From someone booting up ranked for the first time to
        tournament player.

        My lessons have a bias towards the fundamentals and theory behind
        winning in fighting games. I aim to make it's teaching applicable no
        matter what character you play. I firmly believe there are a set of
        fundamental fighting game skills, that when mastered, allow you to be
        effective no matter your choice of character.
