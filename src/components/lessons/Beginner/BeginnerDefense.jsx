      <h2>Beginner Defense</h2>
      <p>You probably aren't blocking enough.</p>
      <p>
        That's it, you can close the article and go practice blocking. For real
        it's that simple for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
        To explain it further, blocking is an incredibly strong and low risk
        tool in Street Fighter, it's very rare in my experience that blocking
        too much puts people in a bad situation, 99% of the time it's blocking
        too little that hurts weaker players. Since Street Fighter has so many
        different options on defense, I think it's easy to get carried away
        committing you options that aren't necessary, and thus many players
        throw games away by overusing parry, dragon punch, throw, mash, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the anime style games I've played, like Dragonball FighterZ
        and Guilty Gear Strive, Street Fighter's guard is an incredibly potent
        option. Plus frames on block is far more rare in SF6 than it is in those
        games, most buttons don't give advantage unless you spend half your
        drive gauge to drive rush cancel. Where compared to Dragonball, any
        button that touches your guard likely means that you'll have to guess
        correctly on a mixup. Despite the relative safety of guarding in SF6,
        new players seem allergic to using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the master level, blocking can essentially become a free win
        action. As it'll convince weaker opponents to over commit on offense as
        they get frustrated by not being able to land buttons on you. When the
        opponents are needing to invite risk in order to win, and you aren't,
        you're typically putting yourself in a much easier spot to win matches.
      </p>
      <h3>Start To Understand Frame Data</h3>
      <p>
        Now all this blocking doesn't really matter if you let people walk all
        over you despite you being at advantage(aka, being plus on block). Being
        plus on block means you can act before the opponent. On average, buttons
        in SF6 leave the defender at advantage, meaning it becomes their turn to
        attack after they've blocked or normal or parried a move. Understanding
        when it's your turn to fight back on block as a defender, is key to
        understanding how Street Fighter actually functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this is unfortunately, not always true. There are some common
        instances when the attacker actually retains advantage, I'll outline
        some of them here, but remember that this is not all encompassing and
        this will require you to consistently try out different things on, or
        seek out frame data to understand the situations.
      </p>
      <h3>Common Advantagous Buttons</h3>
      <h4>Jabs chained together</h4>
      <h4>Some st. MPs</h4>
      <h4>Lots of buttons after drive rush</h4>
      <h4>Lots of buttons during burnout</h4>
      <h4>Some special moves</h4>
      <p>
        On the flip side of this, there's also a large amount of moves that tend
        to be punishable on block, meaning they are so minus that you can hit
        the opponent after blocking their move. The rules here are probably even
        more specific and will take some initial study, but a typical one that
        you can apply is sweeping someone's sweep(although, even this has some
        outliers with sweeps like Chun-Li's who is minus 7).
      </p>
      <h3>Don't get overwhelmed</h3>
      <p>
        You aren't going to develop a dense knowledge of frame data in a day,
        just like execution, think of this as an ongoing iterative process.
        Whenever a specific move is giving you issues and you don't understand
        it, then go into training mode, turn on the frame data display, and
        figure out what your options are against said move. The frame data
        display tells you the +/- frames of every move on block, making this
        sort of labbing much easier. After doing this consistently over the
        course of a few months, you'll find one day that you've developed a
        pretty strong understanding of the cast. Future you will thank you for
        putting in the defensive work early.
