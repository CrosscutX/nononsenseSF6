      <h2>Beginner Poking</h2>
      <p>
        Poking is a vital part of playing high-level Street Fighter, but, it's
        also highly reliant on the opponent's actions. There's a reason why I
        placed defense before this section, and it's because this part of the
        game is dependent on an opponent that isn't playing you in an aggressive
        fashion. Poking is inherently lower reward than the typical noob trap
        tactics that most players fall into. This can often lead newer players
        into thinking that poking is just ineffective, when in reality they are
        just poking too aggressively against the wrong style of opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to be completely clear, the following section only becomes relevant
        once your opponent has ceased using high risk/high reward options such
        as jumping and drive impact. There is a non-trivial amount of players
        that can simply be defeated without the need to ever really poke them,
        as their style simply gives away advantages for free.
      </p>
      <h3>Fundamentals Of Poking</h3>
      <p>
        Poking is the process of using your low commitment normals/specials to
        harass the opponent, and to spur them into making mistakes. Pokes are
        usually either fireballs, or long buttons that aren't punishable on
        block. This is important as landing pokes should never put you in a poor
        position, as the point of a poke is that they can be used to harass a
        defensive opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tactical benefit of using pokes, is that you aren't opening yourself
        up to counter attacks from the opponent. You can use a combination of
        your pokes and your movement to become unpredictable and difficult to
        land hits on. This idea is the cornerstone of "footsies", but high level
        neutral is out of the scope of this lesson and I'd like to keep it
        simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a lot of different attributes that one looks at when it comes to
        good pokes in Street Fighter. How far does your button reach? How fast
        is it? Has fast does it recover? How much damage does it lead to? And
        much more. Usually characters are equipped with many different pokes
        that do different things, and cycling between them makes it more
        difficult for the opponent to counter you.
      </p>
      <h3>Special Cancellable Pokes</h3>
      <p>
        While non-cancellable pokes are important, usually being either harder
        to wiff punish or longer, the real show-stopper in SF6 are the special
        cancellable pokes. In previous games, special cancellable pokes had the
        added benefit of netting you extra damage from special moves, in SF6
        they are even more dangerous due to the drive system. The ability to
        drive rush off of these buttons means that there are a ton of pokes that
        are incredibly threatening to deal with in neutral. Due to their ablity
        to convert into massive damage on hit, and convert into pressure on
        block.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is vitally important to understand on a tactical level. These pokes
        when landed, on hit or block, gives you the ability to force offense on
        the opponent. Unlike the other ways of forcing offense, like drive
        rush/jumping, this is a completely unreactable method of getting
        started, thus becomes the most consistent way to get started at a high
        level. The only reactable tell being your movement into poke range.
      </p>
      <h3>A Quick Breakdown Of Movement</h3>
      <p>
        I decided to lump movement and poking together, because the two concepts
        are very closely aligned. If you wanted a quick spark notes version, it
        would be that walking is the most important and consistent way to move
        around the screen, master it before you abuse the other methods.
      </p>
      <h4>Why is walking the best?</h4>
      <p>
        Walking has one distinct advantage over all other movement methods that
        sets it apart, it has no recovery. While jumping, drive rush, and
        dashing have their purposes, they can all be stuffed by an aware player
        who's focusing on the option. As a rule of thumb, you want to avoid
        overly relying on reactable options to get your offense started, as they
        are inherently volatile and you start to see heavy diminishing returns
        as the quality of defense improves from your high ranked opponents. For
        this reason, you should focus on getting most of your poking work done
        in combination with walking.
      </p>
      <h4>Don't be afraid to move forward</h4>
      <p>
        Forward walking is often times scary for newcomers, and sometimes even
        scary for more experienced players too. I'm going to go more in depth in
        later articles on how you effectively use movement to set up poking, but
        for now just start getting used to walking forward and blocking
        opponent's attacks. Just the act of moving forward puts a lot of
        pressure on the opponent to take actions, and you'd be amazed at how
        many things you open up by mastering this simple action.
      </p>
      <h4>Move back to look for counters</h4>
      <p>
        While moving forward allows you to pressure the opponent and land
        buttons, inevitably the opponent will start hitting buttons to intercept
        your forward movement. This is when backwards movement comes into play.
        Weaker players will use backwards movement to avoid being near the
        opponent, but thinking about it that way will only lead to defeat.
        Backwards movement is a tool to counter the opponent, as you can move
        yourself away from where the opponent expects you to be, and look to
        counter the option they use to hit you. We'll talk more on this later.
      </p>
      <h3>Projectiles</h3>
      <p>
        I'm about to drop the projectile hot take of the decade on you.
        Projectiles are completely unncessary for the vast majority of players.
        They aren't without their uses, but it's so incredibly easy to misuse a
        projectile, that I really hesistate to recommend beginners to use them,
        with the exceptions of Guile/JP but they are easy to mess up there too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projectiles are by and large supplementary pokes to aid your primary
        gameplan of landing your buttons. They don't do a lot of damage, and you
        typically risk 4-5x the damage if you are jumped in on when you use one.
        It's your responsiblity as the fireball thrower to be extraordindarily
        unpredictable, or else you risk losing the match to random jumps. So
        don't bank on fireballs dominating the neutral game, try to find
        consistency through your normals and augment your neutral with
        occasional fireballs to throw the opponent off.
      </p>
      <h4>Don't Tunnel Vison</h4>
      <p>
        I've seen countless players fall into the trance that is the back and
        forth poking war, only to get completely caught off guard by the
        opponent's aggression. Poking is powerful, but only when it is
        unpredictable. It's your responsibility to be shifty about when you
        actually decide to commit to pokes. While harder to counter, pokes are
        still counterable from a variety of options. If you find yourself
        getting caught with DI/Jumps/DR when your trying to poke, then it's a
        good sign that you are getting read and need to change your strategy.
