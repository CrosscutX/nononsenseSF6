      <h2>Beginner Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        You did it, you stuffed the opponent's aggression, and now you've
        secured a knockdown. So what now?
      </p>
      <h3>Oki</h3>
      <p>
        Oki is Japanese term that essentially translates to "wake up pressure".
        There's tons of situations in Street Fighter where you get to continue
        attacking the opponent after a combo. This is typically referred to as
        "getting oki". Oki allows players to lockdown their opponents and force
        guessing situations on them, often times leading to huge damage
        conversions if the defender is wrong. It is your job as a player, to
        experiment with knockdowns to see what oki you get. Also remember to
        test drive rush, as it's necessary to get oki in certain scenarios.
      </p>
      <h3>Basics Of Pressure</h3>
      <p>
        Once you understand how to get your oki, now it's time to start exerting
        pressure. Pressure in SF6 really comes down to 3 core options.
      </p>
      <h3>It All Starts With Meaty</h3>
      <p>
        A meaty is an attack that's meant to hit the earliest frames of an
        opponent waking up. This is the concept that gives the attacker the
        biggest advantage in wake up scenarios, because the attacker can
        threaten the defender with high damage normals, while the defender
        can't. Meatying is a simple concept, it pins the opponent in place and
        prevents them from mashing on you. Get good at this concept and you'll
        be able to control opponents waking up, forcing them to deal with your
        offense.
      </p>
      <h3>Throws Are The Backbone</h3>
      <p>
        Throw is the core tool that really makes Street Fighter offense
        function. Throw is a completely unreactable attack that beats opponents
        who are guarding. Typically the only other way a character can open up
        an opponent low blocking is by using an overhead, but this strategy is
        fickle because an aware opponent does have time to react to most
        overheads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throwing while giving you a nice little bit of damage, is primarily good
        for one reason. Throw forces the opponent to act. If an opponent doesn't
        tech, doesn't backdash, and doesn't jump, they will just die to your
        repeated throws. Predicting when these options will be used, is when you
        are likely to score big damage, even on strong opponents.
      </p>
      <h3>The Shimmy</h3>
      <p>
        While typically not taught to beginners, I think it's important for new
        players to start considering shimmy. Shimmy completes the pressure
        trifecta that allows you to open up any opponent, because it beats a
        very common option select called "delay tech". I'm not going to get into
        the weeds of delay tech yet, but just know that if opponents are teching
        you often, shimmy is the go to option to punish them hard for daring to
        tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shimmy as a concept isn't very complicated, you simply need to walk to
        the edge of the opponents throw range and walk back. Since throws aren't
        reactable, the opponent needs to react to the threat of your movement,
        so sometimes they'll guess wrong and tech. After you back away, the
        opponent will be left wide open reaching at air, allowing you to land
        your biggest punish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shimmy also has the added benefit of naturally beating reversals. So
        implementing shimmy means that'll you'll accidently beat reversals,
        which is nice bonus for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there's much more we could talk about in terms of pressure, these
        3 options are already enough to open up every single player on the
        planet. No single option exists that can beat all 3. So mastering these
        core pressure options can quite literally take you to evo finals,
        everything else is supplementary.
