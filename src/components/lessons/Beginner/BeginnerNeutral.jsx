      <h2>Beginner Neutral</h2>
      <p>
        Most players/beginner resources won't start here, neutral is often
        talked about as an after thought when it comes to new players. I
        understand the reasons for this, as it's a much more dense, and less
        immediately captivating topic. I believe that we as a community are
        making a massive mistake by doing this though, as most players start out
        their fighting game journey developing pretty horrendous habits by not
        understanding some of the core fundamentals of the neutral game. The
        following article is my attempt to rectify this, and provide a much
        stronger starting point for the playerbase.
      </p>
      <h3>Overcoming Your Instincts</h3>
      <p>
        I'm sure if you're engaging with a game called "Street Fighter", you've
        very likely seen videos of some actual street fights. If not, take a
        look at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIPhEpjIank" className="link">
          this{" "}
        </a>
        video. People that don't know how to fight, tend to desperately flail
        their arms around in an attempt to connect with some offense.
        Interestingly enough, as humans become better trained in fighting, the
        pace starts to{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZiZHsPSaE" className="link">
          slow down
        </a>
        . That initial instinct to go nuts isn't the most effective way to fight
        it turns out, but despite that, most people can't fight this way because
        they lack the skill, technique, or composure to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fighting game players are no different in this regard. Most players do
        the fighting game equivalent of flailing their limbs about. Launching a
        non-stop aggressive assault on the opponent, throwing everything and the
        kitchen sink at them in an attempt to overwhelm. While these types of
        matches can be a sight to behold, looking pretty similar to two
        silverback gorillas running into each other at full speed, it does very
        little in terms of helping these players gain a deeper understanding of
        the game. If this happens to be you, the most important step you can
        take in your fighting game journey, is to slow down. Eventually you'll
        come across opponents who don't get trampled by all out aggression, and
        you'll find that you have absolutely no tools to compete with them.
        You'll be back at square one.
      </p>
      <h3>Take A Defensive Approach To Neutral</h3>
      <p>
        Street Fighter is very overwhelming to newcomers, learning to tame your
        opponents and slow down the pace is the first step towards real
        high-level play. During your attempts to play more defensive, you'll
        obviously run into some issues as the maniac across from you tries his
        best to do everything in his power to make you uncomfortable. Honing a
        few tools will make this process much easier.
      </p>
      <h4>Learn to anti-air</h4>
      <p>
        If you cannot reliably anti-air, your opponents will never stop jumping
        at you. This is step one to playing Street Fighter, nothing else
        matters. The risk-reward on jumping is incredibly skewed in the jumper's
        favor, with 1 jump in doing the same damage as 2-3 anti-airs. You want
        to get incredibly familiar with the the ranges and timings of your
        anti-airs, until you are stopping most jump ins with near 100% accuracy.
        It's not an exaggeration to say that this skill is #1 indicator on
        whether you are going to hit master, so drill it relentlessly.
      </p>
      <p>"But Crosscut, how do I drill my anti-airs?"</p>
      <p>
        Glad you asked, a quick youtube search brought me to this video by{" "}

        This video does an awesome job of giving you a realistic drill that you
        can use to hone your anti-air reactions is a more realistic way. You can
        watch it until about 2:55 to get all the core information.

      <h4>Learn Your Good Defensive Buttons</h4>
      <p>
        Although the biggest aggressive option you'll have to deal with early is
        jumping. There's also many grounded tools that characters in SF6 have to
        put pressure on you. It's a good idea to understand what your good
        buttons are to "check" the opponent's aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the board pretty much every character has a button that fills
        this role. For most it tends to be their crouch medium punch. Luke's cr
        mp is a perfect example of a good "check" button. It allows him to cover
        the space directly in front of him, the button is fast, has low
        recovery, and leads to good damage on hit because it's cancellable.
        These are the primary attributes you should be looking for in any check
        button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main options that you are going to use this button against is
        countering drive rush and drive impact. These tools will be used
        religiously by some players, and if not dealt with will have on your
        back foot the entire match dealing with pressure. The fast startup speed
        allows you to beat the opponent's drive rush to the punch, and the low
        recovery and cancellable nature these buttons allows you to either
        cancel into drive impact, or recover so fast that you can drive impact
        even after the button recovers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The button can also serve you well in tons of other character specific
        scenarios, like stopping Kimberly's run, and stopping Blanka's hop. The
        application reaches wide and there's so much that these buttons can help
        you with.
      </p>
      <h4>Stay Composed</h4>
      <p>
        Probably the hardest part of learning how to play neutral, what do you
        do once things are going wrong? The response that I tend to see is that
        most players when met with a rival ape going nuts and beating his chest,
        tend to get coaxed back into their primitive ways. When they get
        uncomfortable, they will meet aggression with aggression, but you must
        fight this urge. Once you revert back to your flailing, you have lost
        the match, even if you are victorious, for you haven't learned anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead you must remain calm and seek to understand what's happening.
        Through doing this you can slowly build a deep knowledge of characters
        and counterplay, and starting this process early will pay dividends down
        the line when you have a deep pool of character knowledge to pull from.
      </p>

        I'll go into more detail about what you should be looking for in the
        next article talking about defense.
