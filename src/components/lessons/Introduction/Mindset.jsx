      <h2>Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        This is probably the most important section that Iâ€™m going to write. The
        single most important attribute that you can have as a player is a
        strong mindset. You can do everything else right, but if this part of
        the equation is off, you will not reach your full potential.

        You should not approach fighting games the same way you approach most
        other games. While fighting games are very fun once you learn them, they
        are also the most humbling genre out there. The experience of playing
        fighting games online, is very often not immediately "fun". Video games
        have conditioned us to want instant gratification whenever we do
        anything, but fighting games stand opposite this philosophy.

      <h3>Get ready to lose, a lot</h3>
      <p>
        Now I understand I'm not making a good argument for the genre, but stick
        with me. The gratification of fighting games is more of a slow burn.
        These games are vehicles for limitless growth. There's always a new
        concept or skill that can be learned, and the fun comes from slowly
        learning and applying things to overcome challenges. In the process of
        doing this, you're going to encounter your biggest challenge by far,{" "}
        <b>ego</b>.

        It is very likely that you suck at fighting games, and that's fine, most
        people suck at games, especially when they lack experience. The
        difference with fighting games is that they don't really hide this fact.
        This is 1 on 1, there are no excuses, the reality of your skill is laid
        bare. This fact is completely debilitating to a lot of people, and if
        you let it, it can completely ruin your ability to enjoy these games.
      </p>
      <h3>It's fine to be bad</h3>
      <p>
        This is something I and a lot of people have struggled with, and really
        I don't have concrete answers on how to overcome it. You will likely
        have to do some soul searching on why losing upsets you.
      </p>

        What I can say is that ego will be the single biggest detriment to your
        growth. Your ego may cause you to displace blame on to other
        people/things, drown yourself in self-loathing, and in the process blind
        you to all of the potential ways you could be improving your game. There
        is no bigger tragedy for a fighting game player, than wasting years of
        their time in a self-imposed stagnation.

      <h3>Adopt a Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        At risk of sounding cliche, I'm going to say that you can definitely
        improve, no matter what your skill level is. Put in the work and trust
        the process and you will see improvement. If you can accept your skill
        level and play to learn and improve, you may find that you enjoy the
        process of playing fighting games much more. At times, I've personally
        been able to achieve a state of gaming nirvana, where expectation melts
        away and you just get to enjoy the act of playing the game. These have
        been some of my favorite moments of playing fighting games, and it's
        worth trying to get there.
