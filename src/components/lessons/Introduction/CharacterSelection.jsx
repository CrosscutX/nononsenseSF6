      <h2>Character Selection</h2>
      <p>
        Character's are a really hot topic in the FGC, so I thought I'd make an
        article to throw my 2 cents at the matter, since some of you may have
        some anxiety when it comes to your character choice. There is one core
        question that you need to consider whenever you select a character.
      </p>
      <p>Do you like the character?</p>
      <p>That's it, article over.</p>
      <p>
        Okay but jokes aside, this issue is really overblown in modern fighting
        games, and there's really only a small handful of players that should be
        considering swapping off of their character due to strength. These
        people need to be both, tournament competitors, and tournament
        competitors that have pushed their character to the limit. If you aren't
        able to get anywhere near Legend rank throughout a ranked season, then
        you simply aren't one of the players that are good enough that you
        couldn't improve by simply training more.

      <h3>An Argument For Top Tiers</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps you think I'm full of shit and character is the most important
        thing at all levels(you're wrong, skill is). I'll entertain you
        nonetheless. There's a really simple fix to this issue that all players
        have access to. You should pick a top tier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picking a top tier is often viewed by weak players as "cowardly" move
        somehow. When the reality is that it is quite the opposite. Picking a
        top tier allows you to take full responsibilty for your wins and losses,
        you know for sure that winning is always in your control, you can't make
        character excuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Players often pick weaker characters as a shield for their ego. Every
        loss can be written off as a "character issue", and you can mentally
        free yourself from the responsibilty of actually taking a loss. If you
        find yourself leaning towards this line of thinking, then I believe it's
        a really good idea for your growth to just swap. Take away the mental
        crutch, and prove that it's a character issue by playing the better
        characters. This should help free your ego and see things for how they
        really are.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the tier lists and character strength will ebb and flow, but
        your skill remains a constant, and is the only thing that really
        matters.
