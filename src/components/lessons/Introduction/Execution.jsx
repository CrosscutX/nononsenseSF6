        This guide won't spend a lot of time talking or focusing on execution.
        Mainly because I have a life outside of Street Fighter, and if I were to
        get into the weeds of execution it would make this thing longer than it
        already is. With that said execution is an integral part of the Street
        Fighter experience, So I figured I'd write a short article about it.
