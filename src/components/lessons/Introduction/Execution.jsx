      <h2>Execution</h2>
      <p>
        This guide won't spend a lot of time talking or focusing on execution.
        Mainly because I have a life outside of Street Fighter, and if I were to
        get into the weeds of execution it would make this thing longer than it
        already is. With that said execution is an integral part of the Street
        Fighter experience, So I figured I'd write a short article about it.
      </p>
      <h3>Take Your Time</h3>
      <p>
        Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your execution. So take
        your time and don't expect to be cranking out crazy optimized combos in
        your first week of playing fighting games. Take an iterative approach to
        your execution. Start with easy concepts in training mode, master them
        and use them in match, and then try to slowly build up the complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find a lot of new players try to really master their execution
        instantly, going for huge combos they've seen pros do, or that they've
        seen the combo trials. This is often completely unecessary for
        beginners, and creates a lot of early frustration when they aren't
        pulling off things that are really meant for much more advanced players.
        So don't fall into this trap, keep it simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any specific issues with execution, you'll likely have the
        most success looking up youtube tutorials for whatever issue you're
        having, or reaching out to the community through reddit/discord. The FGC
        is generally very welcoming, don't be afraid to reach out!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are new, practice your execution daily 15-30 minutes after your
        matches, and you'll be amazed how far you get in a month. Just be
        consistent and patient with yourself. And keep trying to implement all
        of your training mode ideas in match.

      <h3>On Modern Controls</h3>
      <p>
        Modern controls seems to be a pretty heated topic among community
        members, so I'd like to be as clear as possible in what I'm about to
        say. There's nothing morally wrong with playing modern as a newbie,
        you're allowed to enjoy the video game in whatever way you'd like, you
        paid for the damn thing after all. At the high level, I think there is
        still some competitive merit for the control type. If you are a strong
        tournament player seeking to experiment with the control type, then by
        all means this isn't directed at you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people that I believe shouldn't be sticking to modern, are the
        newbies that have decided they are dedicated and would really like to
        learn fighting games. Execution is part of what makes the genre so
        awesome, it's not something you should really run away from. Being able
        to pull off complicated sequences is one of the most fun things that
        fighting games have to offer, especially when it comes to pulling it off
        in match. To avoid classic, is to avoid that great feeling of mastering
        something, and that's the type of stuff that really keeps you going long
        term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Street Fighter, is also not the only fighting game. It's my favorite,
        but there's a whole sea of other games that exist. There's a good chance
        that the best game for you isn't Street Fighter. If you decide to stick
        with modern controls, you're going to find yourself completely
        relearning your execution should you ever try to learn different games
        somewhere down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        So really, if you do decide that you love this genre and would like to
        put some time into it, then simplified controls will really only hurt
        you long term. You should be aware of that.
