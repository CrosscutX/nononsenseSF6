      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        This is the section where I'm going to gloat in case you aren't
        convinced about reading what I have to say! If you aren't sitting on the
        fence still, then feel free to skip this.

        My name is Alex, in competition I use the name Crosscut. At the time of
        writing this, I am a legend ranked Luke player who has managed to win my
        fair shair of tournaments in the Ohio local scene. I first became
        fascinated with fighting games in 2015 when I picked up Street Fighter
        4, and ever since I've been hopelessly addicted. In 2016 I entered a
        beginners tournament during the launch of Street Fighter 5, and I've
        been competing on and off ever since.

        Around 2018 I started dabbling in Dragonball FighterZ, where around the
        launch I was competitive in the top 100 of the leaderboards. I was able
        to attend Evo that year too, where I swiftly got my ass kicked my Nemo
        on stage in front of thousands of people(yes it was very stressful).
        Around 2019 I started competing more in the Ohio scene where I netted a
        few victories in local tournaments in SFV, and proved myself to be one
        of the state's strongest players. In 2021 I started playing Guilty Gear
        Strive, getting decent tournament results and proving that I could throw
        hands with some of the best players online.

        During the launch of SF6 in 2023, I attended a launch tournament,
        beating out some of the best players in the state and cementing my place
        as one of the, if not the strongest player the state has to offer. I
        also got a really nice belt too!

        While not the best player in the world, I've been proven to be
        competitive across many different titles for a long period of time. I've
        managed to break down many different fighting game systems, and decipher
        the fundamental skills that allow great fighting game players to triumph
        over their peers. It took me a long time to develop these skills, which
        is why I'm creating this guide. To share the information that I wish I
        had when I was younger, and help others shortcut their fighting game
        learning process.
