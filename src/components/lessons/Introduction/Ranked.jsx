      <h2>Ranked</h2>
      <p>
        When first getting into fighting games, tons of new players spend time
        their time avoiding ranked. Some players feel as though they need to
        prepare to enter the ranked ladder. Others feel anxiety over the idea of
        losing digital points. Some think it will be too difficult, the quality
        of opponent too demanding. I'm here to debunk these claims and hopefully
        ease you into ranked as it's easily the most efficient tool to leveling
        up your game.
      </p>
      <h3>Preparing For Ranked</h3>
      <p>
        What are you preparing for? Street Fighter has a very solid ranked
        system that does a great job of getting you to the rank you deserve to
        be. There's no way to damage your rank in a way that it won't just
        recover. Not to mention, you shouldn't be obsessing over ranked points.
        Ranked points come from playing the game effectively, and the fastest
        way to start playing the game effectively, is to actively play ranked.
        So not playing ranked because you're scared of placing too low, becomes
        a self-fullfilling prophecy.
      </p>
      <h3>Ranked Anxiety</h3>
      <p>
        What are you scared of? I sympathize here, I used to get ranked anxiety
        bad, and I still have to fight with bad tournament anxiety. There
        probably isn't a catch all fix here, but I can share a personal anecdote
        of what helped me. Anxiety came from attaching of sense of my self-worth
        to the points I was getting. I was stressing out because I was viewing
        the points as something to be prideful about. The way I broke this cycle
        was by shifting my focus from gaining points, to short-term gameplay
        goals. I'd try to work on something and apply it, and this did wonders
        for my mental state and allowed me to take losses less hard.

        Your issues could be different, and perhaps you need to do some
        introspection. If you haven't tried anything yet, then this would might
        a good place to start.
      </p>
      <h3>Ranked Is Too Hard</h3>
      <p>
        This is just a misconception from novice players. If you are new,
        battlehub is much more likely to pair you up with difficult competition.
        Ranked is accurate and will get you matched up with comparable
        competition quickly. That's the whole purpose of the system.
      </p>
      <h3>A Ranked First Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Training mode is a great tool but I think it's often overused by players
        that should just be getting more matches in. When you understand what
        you need to lab, training mode is an insane tool. To make sure you have
        concrete things to work on, I think it's superior to develop a ranked
        first approach to your play sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By committing to ranked matches before you lab, you can take note of
        issues that you're having in match and then spend time labbing directly
        after. This way you're able to get feedback and address issues
        instantly. This is superior to front-loading your lab work early on in
        the session, as if you do that, it's more likely you waste time on
        things that aren't very important.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to make it nice and simple, play a ranked match, spend 5-10 minutes
        practicing a concept you had trouble with, then return to ranked again.
        Repeat until the session is over.
