      <h2>How This Works</h2>
      <p>
        No Nonsense is simply a series of lessons designed to give you all the
        essential information to make you the best fighting game player as fast
        as possible. Each section is a series of lessons that are placed in the
        order that you should view them. While I don't think it would be the end
        of the world if you were to take them out of order, I strongly suggest
        you view them in the order presented, as there is a purpose behind when
        things are presented.

        This course is not meant to be binged. This is simply meant to be a
        companion piece for your practice as you're playing the game. I've
        designed them to be brief, each section no more than a few minutes. I
        recommend you read a topic at the beginning of your session, and then
        use your session to experiment with the information given. Fighting
        games are hard and you need time to digest and apply the information,
        remember this is a marathon, not a sprint.

        Finally, this course is not meant to be the be all and end all of your
        fighting game journey. It’s simply a biased opinion from an experienced
        player. While I believe there’s a lot of people that this information
        could help, there’s really no substitute for tons of grinding and work
        fighting against other very strong players. I’m not naive enough to
        think that I could give you the answers to every fighting game issue
        that you’ll run into in one single guide, which is why this guide is
        intended to give you the basis behind how to work through the issues
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, if you are here, thanks for reading this. It means a lot that
        anyone would hold my opinion in such high regard. Good luck and have
        fun!
