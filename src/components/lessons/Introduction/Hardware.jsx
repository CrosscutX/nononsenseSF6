      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>
        I'm writing this section because a shocking amount of players that I've
        coached have not understood how important a good hardware setup can be.
        Hardware can be vitally important, yet so many players don't understand
        which hardware actually matters.

      <h3>On Controllers</h3>
      <p>
        Controllers are the most overblown topic in the FGC. Stick, pad,
        leverless, it doesn't matter, every single control method is fine and
        you can point to successful players using any of the 3. I've personally
        tried to use all 3, and eventually landed on leverless as my control
        method of choice. This wasn't because of some crazy advantage I got
        though, it was simply that it felt the most comfortable and the least
        hard on my hands. Play whatever you are most comfortable with, and don't
        overthink it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one caveat I'd give is to tell new players to probably avoid stick.
        I personally spent about a year trying to learn the control method, and
        I was still less comfortable on stick than I was on pad a year into
        learning it. Gun to my head, I'd say that stick is probably marginally
        worse than pad/leverless, with pad/leverless being about equal. The
        difference is likely not important in the hands of two experienced
        users, but I believe new players will need to spend a lot of time
        learning the control method.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, if you just find sticks cool, go for it. That's a
        perfectly valid reason to use them.

      <h3>On Monitors</h3>
      <p>What isn't talked about nearly enough, is monitors. </p>
      <p>
        Good monitors can quite literally change the way you are able to play
        the game. A responsive, high performance monitor can make virtually
        every part of your game better, and open up a level of reactive play
        that you wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. When playing on a good
        setup, certain things like overheads and drive rushes can become
        completely reactable, and certain buttons completely confirmable, when
        they'd otherwise be basically impossible to react to.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what monitor should you get? There's a lot that will be in the realm
        of "good enough" here, but personally I'd make sure to get something
        nice here, this is by far the most important part for your Street
        Fighter success. At minimum get yourself a 120hz monitor.
      </p>
      <p>"But Crosscut, fighting games run at 60fps, 120hz doesn't matter."</p>
      <p>
        Yeah I know, but also every 60hz monitor I've ever played on feels like
        dog shit. Also on average, higher refresh rate monitors have a lower
        input delay, which is the real stat that we are after. If you plan on
        spending a bit more, and not just buy the first 120hz monitor you see on
        Amazon, then{" "}
